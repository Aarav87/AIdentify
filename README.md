## What is AIdentify

AIdentify is an android application that uses a machine-learning image classification model to identify the userâ€™s injury and tell them the appropriate treatment. The app allows the user to take a picture of their wound or upload an image from their gallery. Using the image, the machine-learning model predicts the wound type, whether it is a cut, a light burn, a severe burn, or a bruise. Then, the application displays a page for the steps to treat the injury based on the wound type and severity.
